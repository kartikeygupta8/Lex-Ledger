    title: "Top 7 Legal and Financial Mistakes Startups Make (and How to Avoid Them)",

    content: `Launching a startup is a rollercoaster—fast-paced, exhilarating, and sometimes a little scary! But did you know most startups trip over the same legal and financial hurdles? The good news: with the right help, you can leap over them with ease.

Mistake number one? Skipping proper registration. Many founders rush in, forgetting to register their business or protect their brand. Next, there's the classic contract blunder—verbal agreements that turn into messy disputes. Then there's mixing personal and business finances, missing tax deadlines, or ignoring compliance requirements.

The fix? Get a CA and a lawyer on your team early. Your CA will keep your finances in order, track expenses, and make sure you never miss a tax deadline. Your lawyer will draft clear contracts, register your business, and safeguard your intellectual property.

With their guidance, you'll avoid the most common startup stumbles. Instead of firefighting, you'll be building, innovating, and growing your business with confidence. Remember, smart founders learn from others' mistakes—so get the right experts on your side and set your startup up for success!`,
